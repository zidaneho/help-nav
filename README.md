## Technical Details

### File Structure

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration and permissions
- `background.js` - Command processing and Fish Audio TTS (avoids CORS)
- `content.js` - DOM interaction, element finding, and visual coordination
- `assistant-panel.js` - Spotlight panel (chat interface and guidance system)
- `cursor-guide.js` - Enhanced cursor and visual guidance features
- `popup.html/js` - Extension popup interface with voice controls
- `options.html/js` - Settings page for Fish Audio API configuration

### Architecture

Spotlight uses a multi-layered approach for maximum accessibility:

1. **Background Layer** (background.js): Handles command parsing and Fish Audio TTS API calls
2. **Content Layer** (content.js): Coordinates all visual elements and finds target elements
3. **Visual Modules**:
   - `assistant-panel.js`: Provides Spotlight panel (chat interface and conversational guidance)
   - `cursor-guide.js`: Manages cursor enhancements and visual pointers
4. **User Interface**: Popup for voice controls, Options page for Fish Audio configuration

**Key Design Choice**: Spotlight highlights elements instead of auto-clicking them. This maintains user control and helps users learn where elements are located.

### Fish Audio Integration (Optional)

Spotlight supports Fish Audio's premium TTS API for high-quality voice responses:

- **CORS Solution**: API calls made from background script to avoid browser restrictions
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts`
- **Format**: MP3 audio (converted to base64 for message passing)
- **Automatic Fallback**: Uses browser's native TTS if Fish Audio unavailable or fails
- **Configuration**: API key stored securely in Chrome's sync storage
- **Privacy**: Only TTS requests sent to Fish Audio, no browsing data transmitted

### Permissions

- `storage` - Save user settings and API keys
- `activeTab` - Interact with the current webpage
- `scripting` - Inject content scripts
- `https://api.fish.audio/*` - Make requests to Fish Audio API
