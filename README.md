## How to Use

### Voice Commands

Spotlight uses Claude AI to understand both simple and complex commands:

**Simple Commands:**
- **"scroll down"** / **"scroll up"** - Navigate the page
- **"click login"** / **"click search"** - Find specific elements
- **"go back"** - Navigate back to the previous page
- **"repeat"** - Repeat the last action

**Intelligent Complex Commands (powered by Claude):**
- **"I want to make an appointment for my driver's license"** - Claude analyzes the page and finds "Appointments", "Schedule", or "Book" buttons
- **"Help me find cheap flights to New York"** - Finds search or booking interfaces
- **"I need to update my address"** - Identifies account/profile settings
- **"Show me how to contact support"** - Finds contact or help links

Claude reads the page content and understands your intent, finding the right elements even if you don't know exactly what they're called!

### Spotlight Panel

The Spotlight panel provides a friendly chat interface for guidance:

1. **Open Spotlight**: Click the "üí° Open Spotlight" button in the extension popup
2. **Auto-Minimizes**: The panel starts minimized at the bottom-right and automatically minimizes when searching
3. **Ask Questions**: Type questions like "How do I login?" or "Find the search button"
4. **Get Visual Guidance**: Spotlight finds elements and highlights them with multiple visual cues
5. **Interactive Help**: Click "Help Guide" for a list of available commands

**Spotlight Panel Features**:
- **Draggable**: Click and drag the header to move the panel anywhere on screen
- **Auto-Minimize**: Minimizes during searches so you can see the highlighted elements
- **Black Text**: All text is in high-contrast black for better readability
- **Chat History**: All your questions and responses are saved during your session
- **Visual Feedback**: Coordinates with all visual guides (arrows, highlights, animated cursors)

## Technical Details

### File Structure

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration and permissions
- `background.js` - Command processing and Fish Audio TTS (avoids CORS)
- `content.js` - DOM interaction, element finding, and visual coordination
- `assistant-panel.js` - Spotlight panel (chat interface and guidance system)
- `cursor-guide.js` - Enhanced cursor and visual guidance features
- `popup.html/js` - Extension popup interface with voice controls
- `options.html/js` - Settings page for Fish Audio API configuration

### Architecture

Spotlight uses a multi-layered AI-powered approach:

1. **AI Reasoning Layer** (Claude API):
   - Receives user command + simplified DOM snapshot
   - Understands user intent using natural language processing
   - Identifies the best element(s) to interact with
   - Returns structured action with reasoning

2. **Background Layer** (background.js):
   - Handles Claude API calls (no CORS restrictions)
   - Processes Fish Audio TTS API calls
   - Coordinates between popup and content scripts

3. **Content Layer** (content.js):
   - Generates DOM snapshots for Claude
   - Finds elements based on Claude's reasoning
   - Coordinates all visual elements and highlighting

4. **Visual Modules**:
   - `assistant-panel.js`: Spotlight panel (chat interface and conversational guidance)
   - `cursor-guide.js`: Manages cursor enhancements and visual pointers

5. **User Interface**: Popup for voice controls, Options page for API configuration

**Key Design Choices**:
- **Claude AI**: Replaces simple keyword matching with intelligent reasoning
- **DOM Context**: Sends page structure to Claude for accurate element identification
- **Show, Don't Click**: Highlights elements instead of auto-clicking to maintain user control and help users learn

### Claude AI Integration

Spotlight uses Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet for intelligent command understanding:

**How It Works:**
1. **User speaks**: "I want to make an appointment for my driver's license"
2. **DOM Snapshot**: Content script extracts interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) with their text
3. **Claude Reasoning**: Background script sends command + DOM to Claude API
4. **Action Response**: Claude analyzes and returns:
   ```json
   {
     "reasoning": "User wants to schedule a driver's license appointment",
     "action": "click",
     "selector": "appointments",
     "speak": "I found the appointments button. Click it to schedule."
   }
   ```
5. **Element Highlighting**: Content script finds and highlights the element
6. **User Action**: User clicks the highlighted element themselves

**Why Claude?**
- **Natural Language**: Understands intent, not just keywords
- **Context Aware**: Reads the actual page content
- **Multi-Step Ready**: Can identify sequences of actions (future feature)
- **No Training**: Works on any website without custom configuration

**Privacy**:
- Only sends: user command + a redacted DOM snapshot of visible labels/titles/placeholders for interactive elements (buttons/links/labelled inputs) and key headings.
- Never sends: input values, passwords, multi-factor codes, payment or personal identifiers. Password and sensitive fields are excluded client‚Äëside.
- Claude API: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages

### Fish Audio Integration (Optional)

Spotlight supports Fish Audio's premium TTS API for high-quality voice responses:

- **CORS Solution**: API calls made from background script to avoid browser restrictions
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts`
- **Format**: MP3 audio (converted to base64 for message passing)
- **Automatic Fallback**: Uses browser's native TTS if Fish Audio unavailable or fails
- **Configuration**: API key stored securely in Chrome's sync storage
- **Privacy**: Only TTS requests sent to Fish Audio, no browsing data transmitted

### Permissions

- `storage` - Save user settings and API keys (Claude, Fish Audio)
- `activeTab` - Interact with the current webpage
- `scripting` - Inject content scripts for DOM analysis
- `https://api.anthropic.com/*` - Make requests to Claude AI for command understanding
- `https://api.fish.audio/*` - Make requests to Fish Audio TTS API (optional)
